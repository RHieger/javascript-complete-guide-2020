// Use square bracket notation to log 'first name'
// key to console.

// NOTE: Typically you would not want to use a
// two-word key in an object, as it is not considered
// a best practice. It can, however, be done here in
// order to demonstrate this notation applied to an
// object, as opposed to an array.
